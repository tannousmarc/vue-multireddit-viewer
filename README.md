# vue-multireddit-viewer
Using Vue.js to render components that display a user's preffered subreddit selection.

Next steps :

1. Implement localStorage in order to remember user settings.
  - Design settings maybe? colors, # of columns, # of posts to be shown, etc. (would need converting to SCSS as it makes it so much easier).
2. Render subreddits based on user's selection.
3. Create a modal window that opens to display further information.
  - Implement displaying reddit comments when clicking on # of comment.
  - Implement displaying any webpage when clicking on the reddit post.
  - Create a sleek, constant 60fps animation when the modal window opens, abiding by gyrosco.pe's animation principles.
